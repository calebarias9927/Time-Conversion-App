For this project, I referenced the syllabus and some past assignments in coding rooms. 
I followed the syllabus closesly, so i did not add any additional features to this assignment.
The console displays whatever number you type in with the desriptions of and conversions to decaseconds, jiffies, new york minutes, and nanocenturies.
The challange was honesly just trying to figure out what the tasks were in part B. Once I finished the first task (decaseconds), the rest was easy.
